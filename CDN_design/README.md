**Full Description:**

You are tasked with designing a scalable and resilient architecture for a content delivery network (CDN) service. The CDN must efficiently serve a large number of static assets like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files to users across the globe.

**Design Considerations:**

*   **Service Modularization:** How would you break down the CDN into individual components or services? List the services and explain their functionality.
    
*   **Caching Mechanisms:** Describe how you would implement caching to ensure fast delivery of content. Include strategies for caching at different levels (e.g., edge, origin).
    
*   **Redundancy and Failover:** Discuss how you would ensure the CDN remains available even if some servers fail.
    
*   **Data Consistency:** Explain how you would ensure that all users receive the most up-to-date content, especially when changes are made.
